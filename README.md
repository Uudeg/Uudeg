Hello, I’m Degu
I’m currently a comp-sci student in Indonesia. To be honest, I don't really know what I've been doing all this time. 
Time just keeps on moving and somehow I'm learning basically nothing.
But It's 2022 now and I've decided to change for the better.
I’m looking forward to your improvement, my future self!
