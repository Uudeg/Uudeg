Hello, I’m Degu
I’m currently comp-sci student in Indonesia. To be honest, I don't really know what I've been doing all this time. 
Time just keeps on moving and somehow I'm learning basically nothing all this time.
But It's 2022 now and I've decided to change for the better.
I’m looking forward to you, my future self!
